This location contains two consecutive signalized intersections as well as their connecting road segment. The two intersections are positioned on both ends of a large student garage at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. Both intersections have permitted left-turn signal phases which lead to potential conflicts between southbound through traffic on the major road and left-turning vehicles heading for the garage. Furthermore, the connecting road segment contains the queue buildup for vehicles heading to the garage. Between 2011 – 2022, there was a total of 57 crashes in this location.
